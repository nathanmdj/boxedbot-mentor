### Technical Architecture

#### Technology Stack

**Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- Reasons: High performance, automatic API documentation, excellent async support
- Used for: Webhook handling, configuration API, health checks

**Deployment Platform**: Modal.com
- Reasons: Serverless, cost-effective, excellent for AI workloads
- Used for: Function deployment, scaling, secrets management

**AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini
- Reasons: Strong code analysis capabilities, cost-effective for the use case
- Used for: Code review generation, security analysis

**External APIs**:
- GitHub API: Repository access, PR management, commenting
- OpenAI API: AI-powered code analysis

#### System Components

**1. Webhook Handler**
```python
@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint()
async def github_webhook(request: Request):
    # Handle GitHub webhook events
    # Validate signatures
    # Route to appropriate handlers
```

**2. PR Analyzer**
```python
@app.function(secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("openai-secret")])
async def analyze_pr(pr_data: dict):
    # Fetch PR diff
    # Analyze with GPT-4o
    # Generate review comments
```

**3. Configuration Manager**
```python
@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint()
async def update_config(repo_id: str, config: dict):
    # Validate configuration
    # Store repository settings
```

#### Data Flow

1. **PR Event**: Developer creates/updates PR
2. **Webhook**: GitHub sends webhook to Modal endpoint
3. **Analysis**: Bot fetches diff and analyzes with AI
4. **Review**: Bot posts comments back to GitHub
5. **Configuration**: Settings applied per repository

#### Security Considerations
