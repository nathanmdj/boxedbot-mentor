### Repository Configuration File

Create a `.boxedbot.yml` file in your repository root to customize BoxedBot's behavior:

```yaml
# .boxedbot.yml

### Configuration Options Explained

#### Review Levels

**Minimal**:
- Only critical security issues and major bugs
- Fewer than 5 comments per PR typically
- Best for: Mature codebases, experienced teams

**Standard** (Default):
- Balanced approach with security, performance, and maintainability
- 5-15 comments per PR typically
- Best for: Most teams and projects

**Strict**:
- Comprehensive review including style, documentation, and minor issues
- 10-25 comments per PR typically
- Best for: New projects, learning environments, critical systems

#### Focus Areas

- **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, secrets in code
- **Performance**: Inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, database query issues
- **Style**: Code formatting, naming conventions, code organization
- **Maintainability**: Code complexity, documentation, error handling
- **Testing**: Test coverage, test quality, missing test cases

## Using BoxedBot

### How Reviews Work

1. **Automatic Trigger**: BoxedBot analyzes PRs when they're:
   - Opened
   - Updated with new commits
   - Reopened after being closed

2. **Analysis Process**:
   - Fetches the PR diff
   - Analyzes changed files based on configuration
   - Generates review comments using AI
   - Posts structured feedback

3. **Review Timeline**:
   - Initial analysis: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
   - Complex PRs: 2-5 minutes
   - Large PRs: May be split into multiple reviews

### Reading BoxedBot Reviews

BoxedBot provides three types of feedback:

#### üö® Critical Issues (Errors)
```
üö® **Security Vulnerability**: Potential SQL injection vulnerability detected

This query concatenates user input directly into SQL without parameterization.

**Suggestion**: Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection:
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
```
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Issues (Warnings)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance**: Inefficient database query in loop

This code executes a database query for each iteration, causing N+1 query problem.

**Suggestion**: Use a single query with JOIN or prefetch related data:
```python
users = User.objects.select_related('profile').all()
```
```

#### üí° Suggestions (Improvements)
```
üí° **Code Style**: Consider using more descriptive variable name

Variable name 'x' is not descriptive of its purpose.

**Suggestion**: Use a more descriptive name like 'user_count' or 'total_items'
```

### Interacting with BoxedBot

#### Resolving Comments

1. **Fix the Issue**: Make the suggested changes to your code
2. **Respond to BoxedBot**: Reply to the comment explaining your changes
3. **Mark as Resolved**: GitHub will automatically resolve the comment thread

#### Dismissing Comments

If you disagree with a suggestion:

1. **Reply with Explanation**: Explain why you're not implementing the suggestion
2. **Use Keywords**: Include "dismiss", "ignore", or "not applicable"
3. **BoxedBot Learning**: This helps improve future reviews

#### Requesting Re-review

After making changes:
- Push new commits to trigger automatic re-analysis
- BoxedBot will update existing comments or add new ones
- Resolved issues won't be re-commented

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### BoxedBot Not Responding

**Symptoms**: No review comments appear after 5+ minutes

**Solutions**:
1. Check if BoxedBot is installed on the repository
2. Verify the PR contains supported file types
3. Check repository configuration file syntax
4. Look for error messages in the PR timeline

#### Too Many Comments

**Symptoms**: BoxedBot posts excessive comments

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `max_comments_per_pr` in configuration
2. Change review level from "strict" to "standard"
3. Exclude generated files or directories
4. Focus on specific areas using `focus_areas`

#### Comments Not Relevant

**Symptoms**: BoxedBot suggests inappropriate changes

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust `focus_areas` to match your priorities
2. Use file exclusion patterns for generated code
3. Provide feedback by responding to comments
4. Consider using a different AI model in configuration

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: BoxedBot takes too long to review

**Solutions**:
1. Exclude large generated files
2. Limit review to specific directories
3. Use smaller AI model (gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4o)
4. Split large PRs into smaller ones

### Responding to Reviews

#### Good Responses
```
Thanks for catching this! I've updated the code to use parameterized queries.
```

```
I disagree with this suggestion because this is a performance-critical path where 
the current approach is intentionally optimized. The readability trade-off is acceptable here.
```

#### Poor Responses
```
Ignore this comment
```

```
This is wrong
```

### Configuring for Your Team

#### New Teams
- Start with "standard" review level
- Enable all focus areas
- Gradually adjust based on team feedback

#### Experienced Teams
- Use "minimal" review level
- Focus on security and performance
- Exclude style comments if you have other tools

#### Learning Environments
- Use "strict" review level
- Enable all focus areas including style
- Use detailed AI model (gpt-4o)

### Optimizing Performance

#### File Patterns
```yaml
files:
  include:
    - "src/**/*.{py,js,ts,go,rs}"
